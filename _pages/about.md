Hi guys, my name is Tuan. I am now a Software Engineering working at Tokyo. In my free time,

I enjoy coding, reading and running. I am a fan of emerging technologies which involved Computer Visions, Image Processing

and Deep Learning. I love to integrate these powerful tools together and build cool apps whichs help people solve prolems.

Thanks for visiting my sites. Hope you will have good time here.
