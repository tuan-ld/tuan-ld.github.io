Tuan Le Dinh
======

Self-introduction
---------
Hello, my name is Tuan Le Dinh (you can call me Tuan), I was born and grown up in Vietnam. I received my bachelor from Vietnam National University (College of Engineering) in Computer Science. After graduated, I moved to Japan and worked as a software engineer. In Japan, I worked as a programmer for two years, then I decided to pursue my master degree in Artificial Intelligence at Pukyong National University.


Research interest
---------
During my master's course at Pukyong National University, I found my curiosity about Deep Learning applied to Medical and Biomedical Image Analysis. My research job is to train DL models and modify the architecture of these neural nets so that they can work best for medical and biomedical images. Images analysis tasks included classification, semantic segmentation, instance segmentation, etc.

Favorite Courses
---------

I enjoyed watching and taking notes for online courses and I highly recommend you guys take a look at it. For me, these courses have helped me build up my background for an AI research career so much.

**MOOCs**
- [Machine Learning course](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~tom/10701_sp11/) (Prof Tom Mitchell, Carnegie Mellon University, includes video lectures, online slides, 2011)
- [Matrix methods in Data Analysis, Signal Processing, and Machine Learning](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/18-065-matrix-methods-in-data-analysis-signal-processing-and-machine-learning-spring-2018/) (Prof. Gilbert Strang MIT)
- [Neural Networks and Deep Learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/neural-networks-deep-learning) (Prof. Andrew Ng)

**Lecture notes and Homeworks**
- My notes and homework solutions for Machine Learning courses

- My notes and homework solutions for Neural Networks and Deep Learning course


Favorite Books
---------
Besides reading textbooks about math and science, I also enjoy reading books from other fields. Some of the most influenced authors which inspired me a lot include:

- [Jared Diamond](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jared_Diamond) (Guns, Germs, and Steel, The World Until Yesterday, Why sex is fun, etc)

- [Walter Isaacson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_Isaacson) (The Innovators, Einstein: His Life and Universe, Steve Jobs, etc)

- [Malcolm Gladwell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malcolm_Gladwell) (Outliers: The Story of Success, The Tipping Point, Blink, etc)
